## Description
The PrintStringInReverse program reads lines of text from the user and prints each line in reverse order. The program continues to process lines until the user inputs "done" or "d", at which point it terminates.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/PrintStringInReverse.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd PrintStringInReverse 
```
- Compile the PrintStringInReverse.java file: 
```Java
- javac PrintStringInReverse.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java PrintStringInReverse
```

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will continuously prompt you to input lines of text. For each line entered, the program will output the reversed version of that line. To stop the program, enter "done" or "d".  Example:  

Input: 
```Java
Hello World 
```
Output: 
```Java
dlroW olleH  
```
Input: 
```Java
Java Programming 
```

Output: 
```Java
gnimmargorP avaJ  
```
Input: 
```Java
done 
```
The program will terminate upon entering "done".
